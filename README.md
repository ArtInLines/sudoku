# Sudoku

### Todo:

-   Let user switch sudoku (next/prev btn)
-   rewrite solving algorithm
    -   check if square has only one solution
    -   otherwise go to next square
-   let solution checker show wrong squares
    -   instead of showing if the total is wrong
    -   ignore empty fields
    -   if no empty fields and no mistakes, whole sudoku solved
